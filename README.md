## 🛠️ Structure Banane ka Sahi Tarika

Main File (index.html): Isme aapka sidebar aur main sections (jaise Academic Resources, Development & Tools) honge.

Separate CSS: Style ko hamesha ek alag .css file me rakhein. Isse code saaf rehta hai aur Liquid Cosmos wale gradients manage karna asan hota hai.

Assets Folder: Saari images aur custom icons ko assets/ folder me daalein taaki root folder messy na dikhe.

Data Management: Agar aapke paas bahut saare links hain (jaise W3Schools tutorials), toh aap unhe ek data.js file me array banakar rakh sakte hain aur JS se render kar sakte hain.
